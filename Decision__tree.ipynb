        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into smaller subsets based on certain decision rules derived from the features. The structure looks like an inverted tree, with a root node, branches, and leaf nodes.\n",

        "Splitting:\n",
        "Based on this feature, the dataset is split into smaller subsets. Each split is made to maximize purity, meaning that the subsets should contain data points mostly from one class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Decision Node: A point where the data is split based on a feature condition.\n",

        "\n",
        "Recursive Process:\n",
        "The splitting continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met (like maximum depth or minimum samples per leaf).\n",
        "\n",
        "Prediction:\n",
        "For a new data point, the model traverses the tree from the root to a leaf node by following the decision rules, and the leaf node’s label is used as the predicted class.\n",
